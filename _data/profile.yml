    Hi! I’m a PhD in Computer Science from the University of Castilla–La Mancha, Spain.
    I’m fascinated by how artificial agents can learn, adapt, and understand others — a bit like us.
    My research explores Theory of Mind, Multi-agent Systems, and Reinforcement Learning, guided by the question: what does it mean for AI to think socially?
  </p>
  <p>
    I recently spent time at Umeå University (Sweden) working with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1JLu0o4AAAAJ&hl=es" target="_blank">Frank Dignum</a>, and attended an DLRL Summer School  at Mila (Canada) — home to <a href="https://yoshuabengio.org" target="_blank">Yoshua Bengio</a> and an inspiring community of researchers.
    I love connecting ideas from cognitive science and machine learning to imagine AI systems that not only act intelligently, but empathetically.  
  
  </p>
