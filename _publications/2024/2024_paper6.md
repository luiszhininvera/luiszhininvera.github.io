abstract: >-
  Parkinson's disease (PD) is an advancing neurodegenerative condition characterized by motor symptoms, including disturbances in gait and varying degrees of severity, typically assessed using the Hoehn and Yahr stages. Precise classification of PD gait patterns and severity levels is of paramount importance for efficient diagnosis and continuous treatment monitoring. This research article presents a comprehensive assessment of the performance of three distinct Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models integrated with diverse data processing techniques, encompassing segmentation, filtration, and noise reduction, in the context of classifying PD severity. The classification is based on the vertical ground reaction force (VGRF) measurements obtained from both healthy individuals and those afflicted by Parkinson's disease, sourced from a well-established database (GaitPDB, Physio Net). The study provides a comparative analysis of the efficacy of these models in accurately discriminating between various gait patterns and stages of disease severity, underscoring their potential to enhance clinical decision-making and patient care. Additionally, the study offers valuable insights into the impact of data processing methodologies on classification performance.
