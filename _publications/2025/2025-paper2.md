abstract: >-
  The proposed approach incorporates abstraction mechanisms derived from Theory-Theory (TT) and Simulation Theory (ST), enabling agents to reason about bullying interactions either through predefined rules or simulated experiences. The system has been evaluated in a simulated school environment with varying levels of bullying severity, demonstrating its effectiveness in dynamically adapting intervention strategies. The results indicate that combining ToM, RL, and CL leads to superior performance compared to standard RL-based approaches, particularly in high-risk bullying scenarios. This work provides a foundation for the development of socially intelligent AI systems capable of proactive and context-sensitive intervention in educational settings.
