abstract: >-
  We propose an integrative multi-agent architecture that combines \textit{Theory of Mind} (ToM), \textit{Reinforcement Learning} (RL), and \textit{Continual Learning} (CL). Each agent operates under role-specific decision architectures and social constraints. The observer agent employs ToM-based reasoning to infer others’ intentions and goals, guiding interventions consistent with social norms. A risk-sensitive behavioral engine regulates interactions by dynamically adapting roles, rules, and available actions across different risk conditions. Experimental simulations across low-, moderate-, and high-risk environments demonstrate that the proposed system effectively fosters adaptive and norm-consistent interventions. Agents exhibit emergent behavioral role transitions—particularly among initially passive bystanders—and maintain long-term decision performance under evolving social dynamics. Quantitative metrics, including Observer Decision Accuracy (ODA), Social Role Transition Rate (SRTR), Intervention Success Rate (ISR), and Average Episode Reward (AER), confirm the robustness and adaptability of the proposed framework.
