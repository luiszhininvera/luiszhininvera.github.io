  In this paper, we propose a novel approach that leverages Theory-Theory (TT) and Simulation-Theory (ST) to enhance ToM within the MARL framework. Building on the Digital Twins (DT) framework, we introduce the Mindful Human Digital Twin (MHDT). These intelligent systems enriched with ToM capabilities bridge the gap between artificial agents and human-like interactions. In this work, we utilized OpenAI Gymnasium to perform simulations and evaluate the effectiveness of our approach. This work represents a significant step forward in Artificial Intelligence (AI), resulting in socially intelligent systems capable of natural and intuitive interactions with both their environment and other agents. This approach is particularly effective in addressing critical social challenges such as school bullying. This research not only advances the growing field of MARL but also paves the way for sophisticated AI systems with enhanced ToM abilities, tailored for complex and sensitive real-world applications.
