abstract: >-
  Low back pain (LBP) is one of the leading causes of disability in the world's population, yet there are limitations in providing an objective clinical assessment due to its widespread nature. In this work, five machine learning models (LightGBM, XGBoost, HistGradientBoosting, GradientBoosting, and StackingRegressor) were compared to predict trunk mobility based on inertial sensor data. There were 77 individuals with a total of 2160 movement samples of flexion–extension, rotation, and lateralization. Synthetic data augmentation and normalization were performed to be able to work with the data efficiently. Mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and R2 were used to evaluate model performance. Additionally, ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD were used to assess the statistical significance of the models. GradientBoostingRegressor was found to produce the lowest error and statistical significance in flexion–extension and lateralization, while StackingRegressor produced the best error in rotation. The results indicate that inertial sensors and machine learning (ML) can be applied to predict mobility, facilitating personalized rehabilitation and reducing costs. The present study demonstrates that predictive trunk motion modeling can facilitate clinical monitoring and help reduce socioeconomic limitations in patients.
