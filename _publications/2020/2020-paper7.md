abstract: >-
  Programmers with movement disorders do not currently have a language that aids them to write code. This work proposes the creation of E-Move, a friendly Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that tolerates involuntary typing errors. E-Move targets programmers who suffer from involuntary movements in their upper extremities related to movement disorders caused by neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkin-son, myoclonus, chorea, tics, dystonia, and tremor. This work describes the three essential elements that allow the proposed programming language to work effectively: the grammar, the back-end, and the front-end. Additionally , several illustrative examples showcase the usage of E-Move. E-Move was developed using Python, textX, and Pure Python Compiler Infrastructure (PPCI). The result is a programming language that tolerates involuntary typing. Therefore, more people can access coding, which is an important skill.
