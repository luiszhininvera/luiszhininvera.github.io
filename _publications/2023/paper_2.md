abstract: >-
  Parkinson’s disease, the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder among individuals over the age of 65, poses challenges in early-stage detection, often requiring multiple tests to confirm diagnosis. However, advancements in neural network technology have facilitated the analysis, simplification, and prediction of complex problems that surpass human capacity in terms of speed and efficiency. With its diverse array of physical symptoms, we have specifically focused on vocal pitch changes and alterations, as they manifest in approximately 90% of Parkinson’s patients. Furthermore, the acquisition of vocal data is noninvasive and easily accessible. In this study, we employ a convolutional neural network (CNN) to assess the predictive accuracy of Parkinson’s disease using voice data from affected individuals. Our results demonstrate promising accuracy, achieving a classification accuracy of 95%. By training our CNN model, we aim to provide an affordable and convenient solution for detecting this neurodegenerative condition.
