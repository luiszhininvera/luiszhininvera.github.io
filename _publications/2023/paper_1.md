abstract: >-
  This article discusses the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) to classify cocoa beans as healthy or diseased based on established classification criteria, given the challenges faced by the cocoa industry due to the impact of diseased beans on quality and grading. The proposed method uses YOLOv5 and achieved an 94.5% accuracy rate. The article also outlines the development of an affordable and easy-to-implement prototype system that cocoa farmers can use to grade and assure bean quality. The results suggest that the proposed system is successful, and increasing the amount of data improves its reliability, which could help farmers improve their competitiveness in the market.
